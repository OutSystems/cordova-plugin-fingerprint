## Usage

  You **do not** need to reference any JavaScript, the Cordova plugin architecture will add a touchid object to your root automatically when you build.

  Ensure you use the plugin after your deviceready event has been fired.

### Authenticate

  Pass the following arguments to the `authenticate()` function, to prompt the user to authenticate via TouchID:

  1. Success callback (called on successful authentication)
  2. Failure callback (called on error or if authentication fails)
  3. Object with configuration*

  ```
  touchid.authenticate(successCallback, failureCallback, object);
  ```

#### Config Object for
  | Param | Type | Default | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | clientId | String | undefined | (REQUIRED) Used as the alias for your key in the Android Key Store. |
  | clientSecret | String | undefined | (REQUIRED) Used to encrypt the token returned upon successful fingerprint authentication. |
  | disableBackup | boolean | false | Set to true to remove the "USE BACKUP" button |
  | maxAttempts | number | 5 | The device max is 5 attempts.  Set this parameter if you want to allow fewer than 5 attempts.  |
  | locale | String | "en_US" | Change the language displayed on the authentication dialog.<br/><ul><li>English: "en_US"</li><li>Spanish: "es"</li><li>Russian: "ru"</li><li>French: "fr"</li><li>Chinese (Simplified): <ul><li>"zh_CN"</li><li>"zh_SG"</li></ul></li><li>Chinese (Traditional): <ul><li>"zh"</li><li>"zh_HK"</li><li>"zh_TW"</li><li>"zh_MO"</li></ul></li><li>Norwegian: "no"</li></ul> |
  | userAuthRequired | boolean | true | Require the user to authenticate with a fingerprint to authorize every use of the key.  New fingerprint enrollment will invalidate key and require backup authenticate to re-enable the fingerprint authentication dialog. |
  | dialogTitle | String | undefined | Set the title of the fingerprint authentication dialog. |
  | dialogMessage | String | undefined | (REQUIRED) Set the message of the fingerprint authentication dialog. |
  | dialogHint | String | undefined | Set the hint displayed by the fingerprint icon on the fingerprint authentication dialog. |


*NOTE: The dialogMessage you present to the user should provide a clear reason for why you are requesting they authenticate themselves, and what action you will be taking based on that authentication.

### Check support

  Although the `authenticate()` function will return an error if the user is unable to authenticate via Touch ID, you may wish to check support without prompting the user to authenticate. This can be done by passing following arguments to the `checkSupport()` function:

  1. Success callback (called if authentication is possible)
  2. Not supported callback (called if policy can not be evaluated, with error message)

  ```
  touchid.checkSupport(successCallback, notSupportedCallback);
  ```

## Platforms

  iOS 8+
  Android 23+
